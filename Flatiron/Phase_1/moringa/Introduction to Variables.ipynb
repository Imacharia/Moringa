We have also talked about using Booleans (`True` or `False`) to inform decisions in our programming. Often when we want to implement a decision in our code, we'll use conditionals. Conditionals allow us to break up our code in a way that we can selectively perform operations like assigning a value or even just printing text.\n",

Let's look at the code below that contains an if statement.\n",

Next, we examined what is truthy or falsy, and saw that None, 0, empty strings, and lists are all falsy. If we are unsure, we can use the bool function to see the boolean equivalent of a piece of data.
