This is convention and helps to not only remind us, but tell other people looking at our code what that variable is. Let's take a look at a couple examples."

    "we learned how to use loops to iterate through a collection of elements. We started with iterating through a list of numbers, and performed the same operation on each number. Then we saw how we can loop through the numbers and have each number be used to access a successive element from a separate list, like countries. We then saw that to ensure our list of numbers matched the indices of our other list, we had to use the expression, for element in list(range(0, len(list))). Finally, we introduced a naming convention that is commonly used when naming the variable for our loops when iterating over a collection that is a list of common elements (i.e. ice_cream_flavor for a list of ice_cream_flavors)."

    "## On To break And continue Statements¶\n",
    "In the case of break and continue statements, it is almost best to not overthink. break and continue essentially do what they sound like. They are used in tandem with conditional statements (if, elif), inside loops, and they break out of a loop if a condition is met or continue a loop if a different condition is met. Before we dive too deeply into how these statements function, let's look at an example."

    "So, let's unpack what's happening here.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have a for loop that is iterating over our list, numbers, which has 30 numbers in it. Then we see that we have an if statement that only executes its code when our new_list has more than 4 numbers in it. Once this condition is met, we break out of our loop. We then have an elif statement that adds any even number to the new_list, and a final elif statement that tests to see if the number is odd, and if it is odd, then it continues to the next element in our for loop's iteration process.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, first let's dig into the continue statement. continue is telling our loop to skip any code that comes after it and go straight to the next element in our loop. So, if we are dealing with number 1 in our list of numbers, we will hit our continue statement and immediately go to the next element in our for loop (i.e. 2). Any code that comes after the continue will not be executed, but our for loop does not end execution. This contrasts with the break statement. Our break statement is only executed when we have met our condition that the new_list has reached the number of elements we want it to have. Once the break statement is executed, it will end the execution of the for loop altogether. All code after the break statement will be ignored, similar to our continue, but there will be no next step to the iteration. It stops the loop and that's the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, essentially, we can use continue to skip operation on elements and code below continue. We can then use break when we have a condition that tells us we want to stop the process altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at two examples to really reinforce this difference in execution."

    "Let's say you have a collection of elements and that you want to filter out certain elements and create a new list with the elements you want. But you also want to perform a complex operation on each of the elements you do want. Well, you don't want to perform that operation on the elements that you don't want and you don't want to have to write multiple for loops on the collection. So, a continue statement would allow you to optimize your performance and avoid needing to perform those operations. And a break statement can be used when you want to put a limit on the number of iterations you perform, the number of elements you append to a new list, or even just stop your iteration when you have found the first element you want.

To optimize our code, we first check to see if the name starts with w. If it does, we skip all other operations that we need to do and go to the next name. Next we check to see if we have hit our quota of 4 names. If we have, then stop the iteration altogether. Lastly, if neither condition is met, format the given name and append it to our new list of formatted names. This way, we are optimizing our code by making sure that we eliminate performing any operations that aren't absolutely necessary at each step. You may have noticed the variable, check_count. If you are feeling unconvinced that the break and continue are not cutting down on the number of times our code is executing, run the cell below and compare the check_counts, which increment after each check of a conditional statement."

    "Awesome! while loops are great, right? We can use them to perform operations based on the truthiness of a condition instead of needing to iterate over the elements in a collection. They provide a more dynamic way to perform operations, but we need to be careful when writing while loops because we need to have a condition that ends the loop. Otherwise we will have an infinite loop which will give us and our computer a real headache. In this lesson, we also introduced some control flow statements, break and continue, which allow us to make our conditional statements and the rest of our code more efficient and more readable. We call these statements control flow statements because they allow us to control the flow of our code's execution."

The current iteration only moves on to the next iteration once it has completed the entire operation.\n",

    "## Using Nested Loops\n",

    "Let's say we have a list of dictionaries that represent people. People can have attributes that also point to other collections, let's say their pets. So, if we wanted a way to list out the names of all people's pets, this would be a great opportunity to employ a nested loop. Let's take a look at an example."

    "In this lesson, we introduced nested loops. Nested loops are exactly what they sound like. A loop inside of another. Nested iteration is helpful when dealing with nested collections in cases where we would like to dynamically access and use nested data contained in these collections. Nested loops can quickly become hard to read and maintain, so, it is important to use them wisely and sparingly."

Nested data structures can be quite complicated and it can become difficult to access more nested data. With nested loops, you are able to dynamically access this nested data and work with it as you would with a flatter data structure. It is important to think about the structure of the data before and while you're working so you know exactly what data you are working with at each level."

    "In this lesson, we saw some of the benefits of using arguments: they make our functions more flexible and predictable. Our functions are more flexible as the functions vary based on the argument provided to the function. Arguments make our functions predictable by making functions more explicit about their dependencies. They also allow us to change the value of an argument which only affects the function's internal values and more directly shows us how the output of our function will vary based on different inputs."
